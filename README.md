# Smart City Database Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to improve road safety in urban environments by including accident information in its database. The database will log accidents, including their severity and location. This information will be beneficial to city planners, allowing them to identify high-risk areas and take appropriate measures to enhance safety on those roads. The project also aims to warn drivers of potentially dangerous routes to ensure their safety by providing real-time accident information.
